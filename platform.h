/*
 * Function: platform_vsnprintf
 *  Write formatted output using a pointer to a lis of arguments.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  buffer - Storage location for output.
 *  bytes  - Maximum number of characters to write.
 *  format - Format specification.
 *  arg    - Variable argument list.
 *
 * Returns:
 *  The number of characters written if the number of characters to write
 *  is less than or equal to `bytes`; if the number of characters to write
 *  is greater than `bytes`, this function returns -1 indicating that the
 *  output has been truncated. The return value does not include the
 *  terminating null, if one is written.
 *
 * Remarks:
 *  Function takes pointer to an argument list, then formats the data,
 *  and writes up to `bytes` characters to the memory pointed to by
 *  `buffer`. If there is room at the end (that is, if the number of
 *  character to write is less than `bytes`), the buffer will be null-terminated.

 * Returns:
 *  The number of fields that are successfully converted and assigned;
 *  the return value does not include fields that were read but not
 *  assigned. A return vlaue of 0 indicated that no fields were assigned.
 *  The return value if EOF for error or if the end of the string is
 *  reached before the first conversion.
 *
 * Remarks:
 *  Reads data from `buffer` into the locations that are given by each
 *  argument in the `arg` argument list. Every argument in the list must
 *  be a pointer to a variable that has a type that corresponds to a
 *  type specifier in `format`. The `format` argument controls th

 *
 * Remarks:
 *  Converts a time value stored as a `time_t` value into a chracter string.
 *  The `timer` value is usually obtained from a call to *time*, which returns
